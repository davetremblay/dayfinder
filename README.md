# day_finder

A little program to find what day of the week is any date.

Following mathematician John H Conway's famous Doomsday Calendar, a mnemotechnic algorithm to find which day of the year is any date, I created a python function that automates the process. It probably has already been done, but this was more of a challenge to myself than anything else, since I recently started coding.

This code only works with the 4, 100, and 400 rules for leap years, but this is not accurate on astronomical time scales. Therefore, relying on this code to say that "January 1, year 1 billion is a Saturday" is probably wrong.

Input:

-date (integer)

-month (from 1 to 12)

-year (integer except 0).

Output:

-day of the week (text)

Feel free to use it as you wish.
