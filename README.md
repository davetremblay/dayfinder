# day_finder

A little program to find what day of the week is any date.

Following mathematician John H Conway's famous Doomsday Calendar, a mnemotechnic algorithm to find which day of the year is any date, I created a python function that automates the process. It probably has already been done, but this was more of a challenge to myself than anything else, since I recently started coding.

Input:

-date (integer)

-month (from 1 to 12)

-year (integer)

Output:

-day of the week (text)

Feel free to use it as you wish.
